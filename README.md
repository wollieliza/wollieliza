### 👩‍💻 About me:

Hi, I'm an engineering student 👩‍🔧 with a passion for technology and design. My focus within programming is data analysis and data science, because of that I've been through languages such as MatLab 📈 and Python 🐍, but I also know others focused on web development 🖥️, such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Java.

I'm freelancers in the areas of graphic design and UI/UX 👩🏻‍🎨, and whenever possible I'm improving myself, I have knowledge in Adobe Suite software.

### ⚙️ Languages and Tools:

- Python
- MatLAB
- Java
- HTML5
